#PORTFOLIO GENERATOR
---
A portfolio generator for non-coders.
Developed using Flask.

### How to use
`flask run` then open your browser to add and edit your portfolio.
When you're done, `flask compile` to compile to static files in folder `output`.
Now you can use static file server such as Dropbox, Github Page, or probably your school's server to host your portfolio!
